# 🤖 Resume-Based Question Generator

A smart NLP-powered system that reads a candidate's resume (in PDF), predicts their job category using Machine Learning models, extracts key details, and generates personalized interview questions — all in one place using an interactive Streamlit web app.

## 🔍 Theme / Domain
**Artificial Intelligence + Natural Language Processing**

The project combines classical machine learning, text mining, and resume parsing to build an intelligent interview assistant.

---

## 🎯 Aim
To develop an automated system that:
- Predicts the job category of a candidate based on resume content
- Extracts structured details like skills, education, and experience
- Generates intelligent, personalized interview questions tailored to the candidate's background

---

## 💡 Problem Definition

Manual resume screening and question preparation are time-consuming and inconsistent. Recruiters often need to:
- Skim through large volumes of resumes
- Identify relevant skills and qualifications
- Prepare contextually appropriate interview questions

This project solves that by automating:
- Resume parsing from PDFs
- Classification into job categories
- NLP-based skill extraction
- Smart question generation for interviews

---

## 🚀 Outcome / Deliverables

- 🧠 Trained SVM & Naive Bayes models for job category prediction using TF-IDF
- 📄 PDF resume parser using PyMuPDF
- 🛠️ NLP utilities to clean, extract, and transform text
- 💬 Question generator based on detected skills, degrees, and organizations
- 🌐 Streamlit web app for uploading, predicting, displaying, and downloading questions
